# API Gateway Functions

This folder will store some self-contained code using a number of different languages and triggers.

# Directory

* enforceConfiguration: Make sure that deployed API Gateway endpoints are using specific authorizers
* redisApp: A very simple function that works with a Docker Redis container.  Illustrates how to do local development using Docker and SAM
* whatismyip: An application to echo back a requester's public IP address (think IP Chicken)
